# About Me

<p>&nbsp;</p>
I am currently a [Resident Anesthesiologist](https://depts.washington.edu/anesth/education/residents/residentlist.shtml) at the University of Washington affiliated hospitals in Seattle, WA.  I am in the [Bonica Scholars](https://depts.washington.edu/anesth/education/residents/bonica.shtml) research track for training clinican-scientists.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
My research interests lie in the application of machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to clinical electronic health data for improving perioperative risk prediction.  My current advisors are [Vikas O'Reilly-Shah](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/vikas-n-o-reilly-shah/) & [Meliha Yetisgen](https://faculty.washington.edu/melihay/).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Prior to this, I went to medical school at [UCSF](https://medschool.ucsf.edu/).  I spent a year working at [Google Research Healthcare AI](https://health.google/health-research/) division.  And before that, I built medical electronics & devices at the [UCSF Biodesign Lab](https://pharm.ucsf.edu/roy).
